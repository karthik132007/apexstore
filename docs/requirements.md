| Pagination and sorting | Stable paginated product, seller, admin and order listings | API validation and live catalogue test |
| Transaction management | Spring TransactionTemplate, serializable local transactions, persistent order recovery, cancellation compensation | Rollback, concurrency, idempotency and interrupted-confirmation tests |
| AOP logging | OperationLogging aspect with timing and trace IDs | Service logs during tests and live runs |
| SOAP invoice generation | InvoiceEndpoint, XSD, WSDL and InvoiceClient | Real SOAP integration tests and gateway-to-SOAP live flow |
| Validation and exceptions | Bean Validation, business checks, REST error advice, SOAP validation/faults | Unauthorized, forbidden, stock and malformed-request tests |
| Objective | architecture.md | Documentation |
| System architecture | architecture.md | Mermaid service diagram |
| Entity relationships | architecture.md and versioned SQL migrations | Mermaid ER diagram and database schemas |
| API endpoints and responses | api.md and Postman collection | Request/response examples and live evidence |

Syllabus concepts demonstrated include constructor dependency injection, Spring Boot configuration, repositories and JPA, REST controllers, request bodies, path/query parameters, ResponseEntity, Spring Security, CORS, AOP and SOAP. The project brief does not require demonstrating every practice exercise separately (such as setter injection or a second JDBC-only application).
